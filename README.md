# NUMBER-PLATE-DETECTION

Number Plate Detection using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
This project uses OpenCV and Haar cascades to detect number plates in images and videos. The project includes Python code that takes in a video or image file, processes each frame or image using a Haar cascade classifier, and draws bounding boxes around any detected number plates.
The project uses a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for number plates. The number plate images are then extracted and processed using various image processing techniques to improve accuracy and make the extracted plate easier to read.
